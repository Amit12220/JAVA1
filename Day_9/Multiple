Q-Why is multiple inheritance not supported in Java at class level ?

Ans-multiple inheritance not supported in Java at class level because
in multiple inheritance one child inherit properties from more than one
parent.
       Just consider a situation when both parent have same Method signature
 and variables and if we want to call one method , then compiler could not
determine  that from which parent it can get  method(Priority).
